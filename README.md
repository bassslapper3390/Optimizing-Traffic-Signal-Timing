**README for GitHub - Computer Vision-Based Traffic Light Controller**

## Introduction

Welcome to our project repository for the Computer Vision-based traffic light controller developed for the [Hackathon Name]. This project aims to create an intelligent traffic management system that adapts to real-time traffic conditions, optimizing traffic flow and reducing congestion.

## Abstract

Our project proposes a Computer Vision-based traffic light controller that uses live CCTV camera feeds attached to traffic lights. The system employs the YOLO (You Only Look Once) AI model to detect vehicles and calculate traffic density at signals. By classifying vehicles into car, bike, bus/truck, or rickshaw categories, precise green signal timings are set. The algorithm adjusts traffic signal timers based on vehicle density and queue lengths, significantly improving traffic flow and minimizing delays, congestion, and waiting time. As a result, fuel consumption and pollution are reduced, promising enhanced traffic management and overall transportation efficiency.

## Methodology

Our methodology encompasses the following steps:

1. **Vehicle Detection**: The YOLO AI model accurately detects vehicles in real-time using CCTV camera feeds at intersections.

2. **Traffic Density Calculation**: Analyzing the detected vehicles helps calculate real-time traffic density.

3. **Traffic Classification**: Vehicles are classified into different categories (car, bike, bus/truck, or rickshaw) based on calculated density for precise signal timing.

4. **Queue Estimation**: Our custom algorithm estimates the queue length on each side of the intersection to determine traffic buildup.

5. **Optimized Signal Timing**: Parameters are set to avoid excessive queue formation, optimizing traffic signal timings.

6. **Queue Crossing Time Estimation**: The system estimates the time it takes for a queue of traffic to cross the intersection under various traffic scenarios.

7. **Intelligent Traffic Clearance**: Traffic clearance prioritizes heavier traffic directions, minimizing waiting time and congestion.

8. **Real-Time Adaptation**: Signal timings and parameters are dynamically adjusted to adapt to changing traffic patterns.

9. **Testing and Validation**: Extensive simulations and real-world tests validate the system's efficiency and accuracy.
